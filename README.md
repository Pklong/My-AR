# My ActiveRecord

### Description

MyAR is a project I built to learn more about ORM and ActiveRecord.

Each file in lib/ corresponds to a piece of ActiveRecord:

* Sql_object represents ActiveRecord::Base
* Searchable handles the SQL queries, such as ::where
* Associatable creates ActiveRecord Associations, including belongs_to, has_many and has_one_through

### To Do

- [ ] Expand Searchable
- [ ] Integrate with my rails-lite project
